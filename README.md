# Chatbot_Tamil-to-English-Viceversa
The project is a real-time chat application that enables seamless communication between English and Tamil speakers. When a user sends a message in English, it is automatically translated to Tamil for the receiver — and vice-versa — allowing users from different linguistic backgrounds to connect effortlessly.
