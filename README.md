# Chatbot_Tamil-to-English-Viceversa
The project is a real-time chat application that enables seamless communication between English and Tamil speakers. When a user sends a message in English, it is automatically translated to Tamil for the receiver — and vice-versa — allowing users from different linguistic backgrounds to connect effortlessly.

Objectives
The primary goal of the Real-Time Bilingual Chat Application is to eliminate communication barriers between English and Tamil speakers through real-time message translation.
 
 Key objectives included:
• Implementing seamless two-way translation to allow effective conversation.
• Building a stable, real-time messaging platform capable of handling user interactions without lag.
• Focusing on core functionalities rather than extended features, due to the limited hackathon timeframe.
Ensuring user-friendliness with a minimalistic and intuitive interface for easy communication.
